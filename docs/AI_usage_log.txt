1. Understanding Transfer Learning

I asked AI: Explain in easy words how transfer learning works when using ResNet50.
My reason: I wanted to understand why the notebook keeps the pretrained layers and only changes the final layer.

2. Fixing Google Drive Mount Problems

I asked AI: Why do I get this error when I try to mount Google Drive: ‘Cannot find mount point /content/drive’?
My reason: I could not access my files in Drive and needed to fix it to continue.

3. Learning About Image Transforms

I asked AI: What do Resize, CenterCrop, ToTensor, and Normalize mean in my code?
My reason: I wanted to know what each preprocessing step does to the images.

4. Saving the Best Model Correctly

I asked AI: How do I save my best model as a .pth file? The code runs but the file doesn’t show up in Drive.
My reason: I needed to fix the save path so the model would actually be stored.

5. Understanding Loss and Accuracy

I asked AI: Explain in simple words what training loss and accuracy mean.
My reason: I wanted to better understand the numbers shown during training.

6. Understanding Wrong Predictions

I asked AI: Why is my model predicting the wrong class for some images?
My reason: I needed help to understand why images were incorrectly predicted.

7. Understanding the Confusion Matrix

I asked AI: Explain in simple English how to read a confusion matrix.
My reason: I wanted to understand where the model was making mistakes.
