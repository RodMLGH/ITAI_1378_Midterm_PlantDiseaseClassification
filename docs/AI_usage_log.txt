1. Understanding Transfer Learning

I asked AI: “Explain in easy words how transfer learning works when using ResNet50.”
Reason: I wanted to understand why the notebook keeps the pretrained layers and only changes the final layer.

2. Fixing Google Drive Mount Problems

I asked AI: “Why do I get this error when I try to mount Google Drive: ‘Cannot find mount point /content/drive’?”
Reason: I could not access my files in Drive and needed to fix it to continue.

3. Learning About Image Transforms

I asked AI: “What do Resize, CenterCrop, ToTensor, and Normalize mean in my code?”
Reason: I wanted to know what each preprocessing step does to the images.

4. Solving the ‘Cannot Identify Image File’ Error

I asked AI: “How can I fix this error when loading images: ‘cannot identify image file’?”
Reason: Some images were causing the notebook to stop, and I needed to clean or skip them.

5. Fixing the GPU Memory Error

I asked AI: “Why am I getting a CUDA out-of-memory error, and how can I reduce GPU usage?”
Reason: Training crashed and I needed help lowering memory use.

6. Saving the Best Model Correctly

I asked AI: “How do I save my best model as a .pth file? The code runs but the file doesn’t show up in Drive.”
Reason: I needed to fix the save path so the model would actually be stored.

7. Understanding Loss and Accuracy

I asked AI: “Explain in simple words what training loss and accuracy mean.”
Reason: I wanted to better understand the numbers shown during training.

8. Fixing Wrong Predictions in Testing

I asked AI: “Why is my model predicting the wrong class for some test images?”
Reason: I needed help checking transforms, class labels, and data order.

9. Making My Training Loop Cleaner

I asked AI: “How can I make my training loop easier to read and add basic error checks?”
Reason: I wanted clearer and more organized code.

10. Understanding the Confusion Matrix

I asked AI: “Explain in simple English how to read a confusion matrix.”
Reason: I wanted to understand where the model was making mistakes.
