## Project Tier 1

This project is tier 1 because it focuses on creating and training an image classification model (ResNet). The model is built from the beginning using a special dataset of plant leaves to solve a specific problem.

## Problem Statement

For improving crop production and reduce financial losses is very critical detection plant diseases. Nowadays, manual inspection methods are inefficient because they require a lot of labor and are slow. In addition, these methods often lead to human errors, which delay the response time needed to solve the problem.

## Solution Overview

This project aims to build an image classification model that can automatically detect and classify common plant diseases from leaf images. The proposed solution will give farmers a fast way to find plant health problems and take action to care their crops.

## Technical Approach

- CV Technique: Classification.
- Model: ResNet50.
- Framework: PyTorch
- Why this approach: ResNet50 is selected because it has shown high accuracy in image recognition tasks. Its structure makes it easier to train deep learning networks to learn complex image features (disease patterns).

## Dataset

- Source: PlantVillage Dataset.
- Size: 54.000+ images.
- Labels: 38 different classes.
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease

## Success Metrics

- Primary Metric: Accuracy.
- Target: Greater than 90% accuracy.
- Secondary Metrics: F1-score.
